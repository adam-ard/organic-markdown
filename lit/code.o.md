# The Code

This is the code file. Yes, it is all in one file. But that is OK! Because we are using literate programming, the code that gets created is more like compiled code. You are going to look at it (or even check it into git). It is a different way of thinking for sure, but it's really nice once you get the hang of it.

```python {tangle=omd.py}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

@<imports@>
@<globals@>
@<funcs@>
@<classes@>

@<main@>
```
