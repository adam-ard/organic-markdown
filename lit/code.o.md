# The Code

This is the main code file.

Yes, everything is defined in a single fileâ€”but that's totally OK! With literate programming, the code that gets generated is more like **compiled output**. Youâ€™re not meant to read it directly (or even commit it to Git).

This represents a shift in mindset: the *source of truth* becomes your literate files, not the tangled code they produce. And once you get used to it, itâ€™s a really pleasant way to work.
