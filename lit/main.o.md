# Main

Every good program starts with a `main`â€”and this one is no exception.

In Python, the special variable `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` when the file is run directly. This allows us to distinguish between two use cases:

* Running the file as a **standalone script** (when we do want to run the main logic), and
* Importing the file as a **module** (when we donâ€™t want any top-level code to execute automatically).

This pattern helps keep `omd` both scriptable and import-friendly.
